      Hi, I'm Nishant Kumar Singh 👋, a passionate developer and lifelong
      learner and I've completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at
      the School of Management Sciences, Lucknow 🎓. My journey into tech
      started with a curiosity for how websites and applications work, which
      soon grew into a passion for building projects that combine creativity
      with problem-solving.
      <br />
      <br />
      I work mainly with Python 🐍, JavaScript ⚡, Flask, and SQL 🗄️, and I
      enjoy bringing ideas to life by creating responsive and practical web
      applications. Along the way, I've also developed a strong interest in data
      science 📊 and artificial intelligence 🤖. Exploring datasets, visualizing
      patterns, and applying machine learning concepts excites me because it
      bridges the gap between data and real-world decision-making.
      <br />
      <br />
      Through certifications like Data Science with Python (CodeWithHarry) ✅,
      Introduction to Generative AI (Google Cloud ☁️), and the HackerRank Python
      Certificate 🏆, I've built a strong foundation in both web development and
      data-driven problem-solving. These credentials are not just milestones,
      but proof of my dedication to learning new skills and applying them
      effectively.
      <br />
      <br />
      I've worked on many projects that reflect my interests. Some of my
      favorites include a YouTube Manager 🎥 web application built with Flask
      and SQLite, a Weather App ⛅ that fetches live data using APIs, and a
      Train Reservation System 🚆 that shows real-world ticket booking. I also
      created a Jarvis Assistant 🤖 that automates simple tasks. Each project
      has helped me improve not just my technical skills, but also my ability to
      think critically, debug effectively, and design user-friendly solutions.
      <br />
      <br />
      During my internship at CodSoft 💼, I worked on frontend projects like a
      personal portfolio website 🌐, which taught me a lot about responsive
      design, structuring code, and solving real development challenges. This
      hands-on experience helped me grow into a more confident developer who
      understands the importance of both functionality and design.
      <br />
      <br />
      Looking ahead 🚀, my goal is to build a career where I can apply my skills
      in real-world projects 🌍 that have a meaningful impact. I want to
      contribute to solutions that not only solve technical problems but also
      improve lives. With a mix of web development, data science, and AI skills,
      I'm preparing myself to take on challenges that push me out of my comfort
      zone and help me grow as a versatile developer.
