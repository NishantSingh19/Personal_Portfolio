          I'm Nishant, a curious and self-motivated developer who likes to use
          code to make useful, real-world solutions. I started out as a
          front-end developer, making websites that worked on all devices with
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            alt=""
          />
          Along the way, I became very interested in Python, which made me want
          to learn more about backend development and projects that focus on
          data.

          I've worked on a lot of projects that use APIs, databases like MySQL,
          and Git for version control. I'm fine with taking a problem, breaking
          it down, and building something that works from scratch.

          Recently, I've been learning more about data science. I like using
          tools like Pandas and Numpy to look at and analyze data. I'm also
          learning more about machine learning and how to make data
          visualizations. I'm excited about how data can help us make better
          choices and make technology better. I'm currently looking for chances
          to grow, work with others, and solve problems that matter and make a
          difference.
